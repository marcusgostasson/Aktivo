Creating a virtual environment (or `venv`) is a common way to manage dependencies in Python projects. Here is a step-by-step guide to creating and using a `venv`:

### Step 1: Install the `venv` module
If you are using a modern version of Python (3.3 or later), the `venv` module will already be included. Otherwise, you may need to install it. You can check your Python version with:
- On Windows:
```sh
python --version
```
- On macOS and Linux:
```sh
python3 --version
```

### Step 2: Create a new virtual environment
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create your virtual environment.
3. Run the following command:
- On Windows:
   ```sh
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
- On macOS and Linux:
   ```sh
   python3 -m venv .venv
   ```
   where `.venv` is the name of the virtual environment. You can choose any name you like.

### Step 3: Activate the virtual environment
To use the virtual environment, you need to activate it.

- On Windows:
  ```sh
  .venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On macOS and Linux:
  ```sh
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

When the environment is activated, the terminal prompt will change to indicate that you are working within the virtual environment (usually, you will see the environment name in parentheses, e.g., `(.venv)`).

### Step 4: Install packages
Now that your virtual environment is activated, you can install packages with `pip` as usual. For example:
```sh
pip install requirements.txt
```

### Step 5: Run
Run the program:
```
Make run
```

### Step 6: Deactivate the virtual environment
When you are done using the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by running:
```sh
deactivate
```

### Additional tips
- To install all dependencies from a `requirements.txt` file in a new `venv`:
  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
